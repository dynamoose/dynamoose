# Sponsor Dynamoose

:+1::tada: **THANK YOU** for considering sponsoring Dynamoose! Your contributions and support help make this project as amazing as it can be. :tada::+1:

This document gives a little bit more information about that process. If you have any further questions don't hesitate to [reach out](https://charlie.fish/contact).

## Summary

The short version of this document is that there are two ways to sponsor Dynamoose. [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/fishcharlie) is recommended due to lower fees and other reasons, but you can also use [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/dynamoose).

## Methods

There are two different ways you can help to fund Dynamoose. Both are listed below along with additional information about each. Please choose the option that works best for you.

### [GitHub Sponsors (Recommended)](https://github.com/sponsors/fishcharlie)

You can sponsor me (Charlie Fish) directly. I'm the primary maintainer/contributor of Dynamoose, and the majority of the time I spend on open source projects goes towards working on Dynamoose. Therefore any contributions I receive directly helps support my work on my open source projects (Dynamoose being the largest and the one I spend most time on).

This is beneficial since GitHub Sponsors charges very little in terms of fees (at the time of writing I've been charged no fees). Which means more of your funds are going directly to support me and the project. Plus you get some extra perks such as a sponsor badge.

**This is the recommended option.**

### [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/dynamoose)

You can also sponsor the project through Open Collective.

This is beneficial to track the project funding, and has full transparency into how the funds are being used. At the time of writing this, it also has the benefit of more specific funding amounts (since GitHub Sponsors doesn't let you enter a custom amount). You can also do one time donations through Open Collective (which as of writing this you can not due on GitHub Sponsors).

However, Open Collective has much higher fees (compared to GitHub Sponsors), which means less of the funds get to us. After opening the Open Collective account a $5 donation had $0.95 worth of fees attached to it (which is quite a bit).

Although any sponsorship or support of Dynamoose is appreciated, this option isn't as heavily recommended as GitHub Sponsors due to the high fees charged.
