# Contributing Guidelines Draft

- No logs should be printed when running `npm test`. This includes both `console.log` statements as well as UncaughtPromiseExceptions. All logs printed should come directly from Mocha.
- Test coverage should remain at 100%, and cover as many edge cases as possible.
- Linter should pass with no errors.
