- [x] Plugin system
- [ ] ES2015 updates
- [ ] `Model.find` alias

### Release 1.1.x

The main goal of 1.0.x will be to improve the community support of Dynamoose. This includes a massive overhaul of the documentation and testing suite. The website will also be massively improved with better organization, and better usability features. This release might span multiple 1.0.x releases, or might be delayed until release 1.1 depending on readiness of features, to conform to the Semantic Versioning requirement that is being added in version 1.0. The full list of proposed future changes are listed below.

- [ ] Better documentation
- [ ] Redesigned website
- [ ] Improved tests
- [x] GitHub issue/PR templates
