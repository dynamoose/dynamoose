# Dynamoose Roadmap

This is the proposed roadmap for Dynamoose. If you have ideas for how to improve the library please submit GitHub issues. Please keep in mind all content below is not finalized and is subject to change at any time.

### Release 0.9

The goal of release 0.9 is to increase the parity with mongoose. The primary purpose will be to come up with a plugin system similar to that of mongoose although not necessarily compatible.

- [ ] Plugin system
- [ ] `Model.find` alias
- [ ] Complete `.populate` support


### Release 1.0

The main goal of 1.0 will be to improve the code and refactor to ES2015 (ES6). In addition, `useNativeBooleans` and `useDocumentTypes` will be toggled to make uses of "newer" DynamoDB features by default.

- [ ] ES2015 updates
- [ ] Switch to ESLint
- [ ] Set `useNativeBooleans` and `useDocumentTypes` to default to `true`
- [ ] [Semantic Versioning (SEMVER)](https://semver.org)


### Release 1.0.x

The main goal of 1.0.x will be to improve the community support of Dynamoose. This includes a massive overhaul of the documentation and testing suite. The website will also be massively improved with better organization, and better usability features. This release might span multiple 1.0.x releases, or might be delayed until release 1.1 depending on readiness of features, to conform to the Semantic Versioning requirement that is being added in version 1.0. The full list of proposed future changes are listed below.

- [ ] Better documentation
- [ ] Redesigned website
- [ ] Improved tests
- [ ] GitHub issue/PR templates
- [ ] Contribution guidelines
