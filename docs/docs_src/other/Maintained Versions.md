Dynamoose has a policy of removing support for old major versions of Dynamoose overtime. This is to encourage users to stay updated, and to limit the burden of back-porting changes to older versions, as well as making it easier for maintainers to focus on the future of Dynamoose.

Bug fixes and security updates will be included in either patch or minor versions, and will not be guaranteed to be back-ported to previous minor versions.

More details about our security policy can be found [here](https://github.com/dynamoose/dynamoose/security/policy).
