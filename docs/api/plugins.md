## Plugins (BETA)

**WARNING: PLUGINS IS CURRENTLY IN BETA. THIS FUNCTIONALITY MIGHT CHANGE AT ANYTIME WITHOUT WARNING. DO NOT CONSIDER THIS FEATURE TO BE STABLE.**

Please view the `Model.plugin` documentation for how to use plugins in your own models. This documentation will be going over how to create plugins from scratch.

### Overview

All plugins will export a function. Dynamoose will pass in 2 parameters into that function. `plugin` and `options`. `options` is the object that was passed into `Model.plugin`. `plugin` properties are defined below.

### plugin.setName

Set the name of the plugin.

#### Parameters accepted

- `name` - Name of plugin (string)


### plugin.setDescription

Set the description of the plugin.

#### Parameters accepted

- `description` - Description of plugin (string)


### plugin.on

Adds a listener to emitted events from Dynamoose. You can return a promise in the `callback` method that you pass in, and when it is called, Dynamoose will `await` for your promise to complete before continuing. Your promise must `resolve` and not `reject`. You can resolve an object with the property `resolve` or `reject` to return or reject with that result to the end user. At that point Dynamoose will take no further action. This can be useful if you want to handle more of the interaction with the user.

#### Parameters accepted

- [`event`] - Type of event you wish to listen for from Dynamoose, you can view possible options below, if not passed in it will catch all events (string) (optional)
- [`stage`] - Type of stage you wish you listen for from Dynamoose within the event, if not passed in it will catch all events (string) (optional) (note: if this is passed in `event` is required)
- `callback` - Function to be run when event is emitted from Dynamoose (function)
	- `obj` - Object with properties and methods about event emitted from Dynamoose, you can view more details below (object)


### Example Plugin Implementation

```js
module.exports = (plugin, options) => {
	plugin.setName('My Plugin'); // required
	plugin.setDescription(''); // optional
	plugin.on('init', () => { // this will handle all stages related to init
		console.log('Plugin registered');
	});
	plugin.on('scan', 'preRequest', (obj) => { // this will handle only preRequest stages on the scan type
		console.log('About to make request to DynamoDB');
	});
	plugin.on('scan', 'postRequest', (obj) => { // this will handle only postRequest stages on the scan type, and will wait for promise to resolve before moving on
		return new Promise((resolve) => {
			resolve({
				resolve: 'Hello World' // 'Hello World' will be passed back to the promise/callback of the Dynamoose scan call
			});
		});
	});
	plugin.on('query', 'postRequest', (obj) => { // this will handle only postRequest stages on the scan type, and will wait for promise to resolve before moving on
		return new Promise((resolve) => {
			resolve({
				reject: 'My Error' // 'My Error' will be passed back to the promise/callback of the Dynamoose scan call as an error (not successful)
			});
		});
	});
	return plugin;
}
```

### Items Passed Into .on callback object

Below is the default object passed into the callback object, each event might add more properties and methods to this object.

```
{
	model: _____, // the model instance (object)
	modelName: _____, // the model name (string)
	plugins: _____, // array of plugins registered to model (array)
	plugin: _____, // the plugin that is being called (object)
	event: {
		type: _____, // the type of event that was emitted from Dynamoose (ex. "plugin:register") (string)
		stage: _____ // the stage that was emitted from Dynamoose (ex. "pre", "post") (string)
	}
	actions: {
		registerPlugin: _____ // register function to model, just a pointer to Model.plugin function (this can be useful for creating sub-plugins) (function)
	}
}
```

### Events emitted from Dynamoose

#### `*`

Catch all to run listener on all events emitted from Dynamoose.

#### `plugin`

Dynamoose will emit this event when your plugin is registered to a model.

##### Stages

- `init` - Dynamoose will emit this stage when your plugin **has been** registered to a model

##### Additional Items Added to Object

```
{
}
```

#### `plugin:register`

Dynamoose will emit this event when a new plugin is registered to a model.

##### Stages

- `pre` - Dynamoose will emit this stage when a new plugin **is about to be** registered to a model
