Dynamoose interacts directly with the [AWS-SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-sdk), therefore, it is required that you authenticate and provide valid credentials so Dynamoose can successfully make requests to DynamoDB.

It is recommended that you do this as early in the application life cycle as possible to prevent issues where Dynamoose will try to make requests to DynamoDB that are unauthenticated.

There are a few ways to do this.

## Environment Variables

You can use environment variables to setup your configuration.

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = "Your AWS Access Key ID"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = "Your AWS Secret Access Key"
export AWS_REGION = "us-east-1"
```

## Programatically

### Global

The following code will change the AWS-SDK global settings to use the configuration options.

```js
dynamoose.aws.sdk.config.update({
	"accessKeyId": "AKID",
	"secretAccessKey": "SECRET",
	"region": "us-east-1"
});
```

### Dynamoose Specific

The following code will create a new DynamoDB instance with the specific configuration options and use that in Dynamoose.

```js
// Create new DynamoDB instance
const ddb = new dynamoose.aws.sdk.DynamoDB({
	"accessKeyId": "AKID",
	"secretAccessKey": "SECRET",
	"region": "us-east-1"
});

// Set DynamoDB instance to the Dynamoose DDB instance
dynamoose.aws.ddb.set(ddb);
```

## IAM Role

If you are running Dynamoose in an environment that has an IAM role attached to it (ex. [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) or [EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)), you do not need to do any additional configuration so long as your IAM role has appropriate permissions to access DynamoDB.

## Local

You can also configure Dynamoose to use [DynamoDB Local](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBLocal.html).

If your DynamoDB Local server is running on `http://localhost:8000` you can use the following command.

```js
dynamoose.aws.ddb.local();
```

Otherwise if your local DynamoDB server is running at a different location you can pass that in as an argument. For example if your server is running at `http://localhost:1234` you can run the following command.

```js
dynamoose.aws.ddb.local("http://localhost:1234");
```
