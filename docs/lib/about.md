# Library

This section is autogenerated from our JSDoc comments. All of these sections will be regenerated with each release. If there is a discrepency between the [API](/api/about) docs and this, these are the ones to trust.

## Plugin

Our [Plugin](/lib/Plugin) class is a vital part of our extensibilty. A Plugin allows you to create your own features and methods to rund during the processing of a model. There are some examples around this in the doc itself. Expect to see more examples coming in the future as we build towards Dynamoose 2.0.

## VirtualType

Our [VirtualType](/lib/VirtualType) class is partially documented currently.
