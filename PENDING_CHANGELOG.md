# Dynamoose Changelog

---

### Maintenance

- Store CLA signatures on a dedicated branch so protected main does not block contributors from signing

### Features

- Added support for enabling and configuring DynamoDB Streams through Table options

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed `deep_copy` dropping sibling properties that share the same object reference (e.g. a single `Date` used for both `createdAt` and `updatedAt`, or a single address used for both `billingAddress` and `shippingAddress`). Circular reference detection now tracks only the current ancestor path rather than every object ever visited, which also removes an infinite-recursion risk on self-referencing arrays and a shared-reference leak on class instances containing circular properties
- Fixed `dynamoose.transaction` get results skipping schema `get` modifiers. Items returned from a `transactGetItems` transaction now run attribute `get` functions the same as `Model.get`, `Model.batchGet`, `Model.query`, and `Model.scan`
- Fixed `Model.update` typing a value by another attribute's schema when a `$REMOVE` came before it. For example `{"$REMOVE": ["tags"], "$SET": {"list": ["a", "b"]}}` stored `list` as a string set, because values were paired with attribute names by position
- Fixed `Model.update` and `Model.transaction.update` not writing a `Combine` attribute when the model also has a `forceDefault` attribute. Both were given the same placeholder (e.g. `#a2`), so the request set the default value twice and left the combine attribute out
- Fixed `Model.update` and `Model.transaction.update` counting a combined attribute changed with `$ADD` or `$DELETE` as set when the update also set an attribute whose placeholder starts with its placeholder (`#a1` and `#a10`). The combine value was built from the amount added instead of throwing `You must update all or none of the combine attributes`
- Fixed the `expires` TTL attribute being silently dropped from every model registered against a table after the first. A model attaching to an already-constructed table did not receive the TTL attribute injection the `Table` constructor performs, so its writes stored no TTL attribute at all while DynamoDB continued to report `TimeToLiveStatus: ENABLED`. Affected every table shared by two or more distinct `Schema` objects, across `create`, `transaction.create`, and `update`
