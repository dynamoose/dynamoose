### ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨

- Upgraded to AWS-SDK v3.
	- This leads to a MASSIVE reduction in the package size of Dynamoose.
	- Only users using the `dynamoose.aws` object will be impacted (if you are only using `dynamoose.aws.ddb.local`, there will be no breaking changes).
	- In depth changelog:
		- `dynamoose.aws.sdk` has been removed.
		- `dynamoose.aws.ddb` now references a `@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb` `DynamoDB` instance instead of the previous `AWS.DynamoDB` instance.
			- Please refer to the AWS-SDK v3 changelogs for more information about what this means for you.
		- `dynamoose.aws.converter` now uses the methods from `@aws-sdk/util-dynamodb`.
			- `input` has changed to `convertToAttr`.
			- `output` has changed to `convertToNative`.
			- For more information please refer to the AWS-SDK v3 changelogs.
		- You can use `dynamoose.aws.ddb.DynamoDB` to create a new `@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb` `DynamoDB` instance.
- `dynamoose.model.defaults` has been renamed to `dynamoose.Table.defaults`.
- DynamoDB table initialization/updates will no longer be done upon creating a model. Instead they will be done when you initialize a `dynamoose.Table` instance, or whenever you make a DynamoDB request for a given model (ex. `get`, `create`, `update`).
- Renamed `Document` to `Item`.
	- The largest user facing API change is changing `{"return": "document"}` to `{"return": "item"}` and `{"return": "documents"}` to `{"return": "items"}`.
- `set` Schema attribute settings are now used when retrieving items (ie. `get`, `query`, `update`, etc).
- Passing `{"return": "request"}` as a setting into the following methods are now preformed asynchronously:
	- `Model.get`
	- `Model.delete`
	- `Model.batchGet`
	- `Model.batchDelete`
- Default values are now only applied if the parent object exists. For example nested object properties with a default value will only be applied if the parent object exists. If this is not what you intended, consider adding a `default` value of an empty object (`{}`) or array (`[]`) to the parent attribute.
- `dynamoose.logger` is now an async function instead of an object. For example, `dynamoose.logger.status()` is now `(await dynamoose.logger()).status()`.
	- You must also now install the `dynamoose-logger` package in order to use `dynamoose.logger()`, otherwise an error will be thrown.
- Renaming `seperator` to `separator` in Combine type settings to fix typo.
- Renaming `miliseconds` to `milliseconds` in Date type settings to fix typo.
- Migrate properties to new `dynamoose.type` object.
	- `dynamoose.UNDEFINED` is now `dynamoose.type.UNDEFINED`.
	- `dynamoose.THIS` is now `dynamoose.type.THIS`.
	- `dynamoose.NULL` is now `dynamoose.type.NULL`.
- Stricter validation of Schema types. If you pass in an invalid schema attribute type, it will now throw an error upon initialization.
	- For example, `new dynamoose.Schema({"id": "random"})` will now throw an error.
- `Model.table.create.request()` has been replaced by `Model.table().create({"return": "request"})`.
- Node.js >=v12 now required.
- New IAM roles (`listTagsOfResource`, `tagResource`, `untagResource`) required if `update` is set to true.
- `index.global` property has been removed within Schema Attribute Settings. It has been replaced with `index.type`, which accepts `"global"` or `"local"` as values. This setting remains optional (however, the default value has changed).
- Indexes by default will be global as opposed to local.

### Major New Features

- Added support for multiple Dynamoose instances (`dynamoose.Instance`). This allows you easily make requests to multiple AWS DynamoDB regions.

### General

- Added `dynamoose.Table` class. `dynamoose.model` now represents an entity or type of data (ex. User, Movie, Order), and `dynamoose.Table` represents a single DynamoDB table. By default, whenever you first use a model, a `dynamoose.Table` instance will be created for you, to ensure backwards compatibility with v2. If you want to create the table manually, you can change your code like so:
```
// If you have the following code in v2:

const User = dynamoose.model("User", {"id": String});

// It will be converted to this in v3:

const User = dynamoose.model("User", {"id": String});
const DBTable = new dynamoose.Table("DBTable", [User]);
```
- Added `get` & `set` modifier options to Schema settings to allow for Item wide modification.
- Added `validate` method option to Schema settings to allow for Item wide validation.
- Added `tags` setting to Table, to be able to add tags to a table.
- Added `map` setting to Schema type settings to allow for easily converting DynamoDB attribute names to more human readable names (ex. `pk` to `userId` and `sk` to `orderId`). This can also be used for aliases. This also includes a `defaultMap` property that can be used to overwrite what property name Dynamoose should use when retrieving an item from DynamoDB.
- Added `dynamoose.type.ANY` type to allow for schema attributes to be any type. You can also set this on the `schema` setting of a property to allow the object/array to have any children properties.
- Added `tableClass` option to Table settings to allow for setting a table to DynamoDB's new infrequent access class option.
- Added `table.create()` method to create a table manually.
- Added `table.name` property to be able to access table name.
- Added `table.hashKey` property to be able to access table's hash key.
- Added `table.rangeKey` property to be able to access table's range key.
- Added `model.name` property to be able to access model name.
- Added `dynamoose.type.CONSTANT` helper function to create a constant type.
- Added `dynamoose.type.COMBINE` helper function to create a combine type.
- Added `schema.hashKey` & `schema.rangeKey` properties to allow you to access the hash and range keys of your schemas.
- Added `schema.indexAttributes` property that returns an array of strings with each string representing the attribute name of each index.
- Added `item.withDefaults` function that will return a new object with default values applied.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed bug where using `model` as an attribute name in your Schema would cause random TypeMismatch errors.
- Fixed an issue where after doing certain Item related operations, the original object passed in could be mutated. This is no longer the case and original items will not be mutated when doing Item related operations.

### Documentation

- JSDoc documentation (Beta)! In certain editors such as VSCode, this allows you to hover over Dynamoose functions and attributes to see their documentation.
- Dynamoose's website now respects your OS color theme preference instead of always defaulting to light mode.
- Migrated documentation from Vercel to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) for PR & branch builds.
- Adding new pages for documentation:
	- Maintained Versions
	- Version Requirements
- Added [`/version` page](https://dynamoosejs.com/version) to documentation to easily view the Dynamoose npm version & Git commit SHA of the documentation you are viewing.
- Added [robots.txt](https://dynamoosejs.com/robots.txt) file to documentation.
- Added [YouTube channel link](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw4K_PDdzsZPM1PSeqS997Q) to documentation footer.

### Other

- Source map files are no longer included in the package.
	- You can generate source map files by cloning the repository, running `npm install`, then running `npm run build:sourcemap`. The generated source map files will be located in the `dist` folder.
- Made a lot of internal properties private.
	- This is not considered a breaking change since only documented properties, classes, methods, and functions are included in breaking changes. You should only be using documented properties, classes, methods, and functions in Dynamoose. Anything not documented is subject to change at anytime, and can lead to unexpected behavior. Read more at [this FAQ item](https://dynamoosejs.com/other/FAQ#can-i-use-an-undocumented-property-class-method-or-function-in-dynamoose).
- Moved `source-map-support` package into `devDependencies`.
- Using [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org) to manage sub-packages for Dynamoose.
